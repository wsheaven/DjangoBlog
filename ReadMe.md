# Overview

This program is a simple blog that is dynamically populated by Django. I followed a tutorial to start the site and then added the ability to create your own posts and I am currently working on implementing a User management system to allow different users to be created and to post to the blog. 

To start the blog on my computer you need to open a terminal and run 'python manage.py runserver' and then go to localhost:8000 

I decided to write this site because I wanted to learn Django and it seemed to be great practice in the scope I was looking for.
